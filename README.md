#  Coding Protocol  
### Internship & Placement Application Platform

**Hackathon:** Hack’Vento 2026  
**Organized by:** GDGoC IET DAVV  
**Team Name:** Coding Protocol

##  Overview

**Coding Protocol** is a web-based internship and placement application platform designed to simplify the application process for students and provide administrators with a centralized system to manage applications efficiently.

The platform offers **two separate interfaces**:
- **Student Portal** – for submitting internship and placement applications  
- **Admin Panel** – for reviewing, approving, rejecting, and managing applications  

The goal is to replace manual and scattered application processes with a **single, structured, and easy-to-use digital solution**.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Students often struggle to manage multiple internship and placement applications, which can lead to confusion, errors, and missed opportunities.  
Administrators, on the other hand, require a simple and organized way to review, track, and manage large volumes of applications without relying on spreadsheets or manual workflows.

---

## 💡 Solution

Coding Protocol provides a **centralized application management system** that:

- Enables students to submit applications through a clean and user-friendly interface  
- Allows administrators to securely view and manage all applications in one place  
- Stores and updates data in real time using cloud-based services  

This improves efficiency, transparency, and overall user experience for both students and administrators.
