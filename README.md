#  Coding Protocol

### Internship & Placement Application Platform

**Hackathon:** Hack’Vento 2026

**Organized by:** GDGoC IET DAVV

**Team Name:** Coding Protocol


##  Overview

The **Coding Protocol** is a website that helps students apply for internships and jobs. It makes the process easier for them. At the time it gives people in charge a simple way to keep track of all the applications they get. This way everyone can use one system to manage everything. The **Coding Protocol** is really good, for students and administrators because it helps them work together easily.

The platform has two interfaces the platform offers these two interfaces to users and these interfaces are part of the platform.

- **Student Portal** – for submitting internship and placement applications

- **Admin Panel** – for reviewing, approving, rejecting, and managing applications

The goal is to get rid of manual and all over the place application processes. We want to use a digital solution that is structured and easy to use. This digital solution should be simple. Make things easier, for everyone. The idea is to have a **structured and easy-to-use digital solution** that replaces all the old ways of doing things.

##  Problem Statement

Students often struggle to manage multiple internship and placement applications, which can lead to confusion, errors, and missed opportunities.

Administrators need a system that's easy to use and straightforward. This system should help them look at a lot of applications keep track of them and manage them without having to use spreadsheets or do everything by hand. Administrators want to be able to review applications and stay on top of things. Administrators need something that will make their job easier when it comes to handling volumes of applications.



##  Solution

Coding Protocol provides a system that helps manage applications, in one place, which's the **centralized application management system** that does a few things like:

- Enables students to submit applications through a clean and user-friendly interface

- Allows administrators to securely view and manage all applications in one place

- Stores and updates data in real time using cloud-based services

This makes things better for students and administrators. It helps them do things efficiently and they can see what is going on. The user experience is also better, for both students and administrators.

The Coding Protocol shows us how a web application that is easy to understand can help with problems that people face when they are doing internships or looking for jobs. This project is about making things clear and simple to use. It actually works, using the latest web technologies, which makes the Coding Protocol a good tool for schools, hackathons and real life situations where people need to manage internships and job placements. The Coding Protocol is really useful, for people who want to learn how to make web applications that can solve real-world problems.
